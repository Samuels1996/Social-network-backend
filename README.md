# Social Network Backend

This is a backend database for a social networking site. It utilizes Javascript, MongoDB, mongoose, as well as a few other npm packages. 

## Usage 

To be able to use this backend database pull the repository from github and run npm i as well as npm run build and launch the server. This backend must be used in insomnia.
